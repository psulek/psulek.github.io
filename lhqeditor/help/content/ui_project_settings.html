<h2>Layout settings</h2>
<p>This setting allows you to define whether resources should be organized in a tree hierarchy or in a flat structure. When tree hierarchy is selected, you can also define if resources are allowed to be located directly in the root category.</p>

<p class="noteBlock">Note: In the current version of Localization HQ, this setting is fixed (only <b>tree hierarchy</b> is allowed, and resources <b>cannot</b> be created directly under the project root).</p>

<p>In future versions of Localization HQ, the following notes will apply:</p>

<p class="defaultBlock">Default values: <b>categories and resources</b> selected, <b>allowed resources under root category</b> unchecked</p>
<p class="noteBlock">Note: You can change the layout settings later.</p>
<p class="tipBlock">Tip: Once you created resources under categories in a tree structure, it is no longer possible to switch to flat structure. In order to change these settings, you have to either delete those resources or move them under the root category.</p>
