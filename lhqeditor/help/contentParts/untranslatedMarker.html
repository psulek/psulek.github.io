<h3>Indicators of empty translations</h3>
<p>If a resource contains translations which are empty (at least on language field has no translation), it is marked by a red vertical indicator in the navigation tree. Analogously, all parent objects (categories) are automatically marked. If a category has this indicator, it means that at least one resource below this category has some empty translation.</p>	
<p>Example: Resources A1 and A3 have both English and German translations. Resource A2 has empty German translation, thus it is marked by the red indicator (and categories above).</p>
