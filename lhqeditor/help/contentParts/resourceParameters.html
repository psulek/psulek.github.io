<p class="noteBlock">Note: The resource parameter names must be unique within a resource.</p>
<p class="purposeBlock">Resource parameters are used to generate strings which can have variable parts. Example:<br>
Hi {0}, we are glad you are back.<br>
In this case, {0} means that a variable with id 0 will be placed here, e.g. a user display name.</p>
